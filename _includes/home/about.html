    <h1>About&nbsp;me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a software developer, currently based in Belfast, with experience in a range of programming languages
      and technologies and specialising in .NET and Javascript.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe that there is more to software development than simply producing code that works.  I create well-crafted
      solutions following Domain Driven Design principles to provide real value and an adaptable codebase that
      can evolve along with the business.
