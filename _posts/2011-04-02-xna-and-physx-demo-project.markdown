For an assignment at university I have created a small demo project in [XNA](http://create.msdn.com) which makes use of a PhysX .NET wrapper project which can be found [here](http://physxdotnet.codeplex.com/).  The demo features a height field actor, revolute joints, breakable fixed joints, convex meshes, force fields and collision callbacks.   I’m currently thinking about writing some basic tutorials for PhysX and XNA but this will be at some point in the future as I’m fairly short on time at the minute.

Check out the video after the break.
