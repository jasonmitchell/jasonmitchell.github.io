Earlier this year I was asked to be a technical reviewer for a new XNA book called Microsoft XNA 4.0 Game Development Cookbook by Luke Drumm ([Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft-XNA-Game-Development-Cookbook/dp/1849691983)); it is a problem-solution book covering quite a range of intermediate+ level topics.  The book mainly focusses on Windows projects however the author's inclusion of solutions for XNA's Reach and HiDef profiles (and the ease of reusing XNA code across Microsoft platforms) means that nearly all of the recipes are usable for Xbox and Windows Phone 7/7.5 projects.

Book contents (see Amazon for a more detailed table of contents):




  * Applying special effects; shadows, lens flare, smoke, explosions


  * 2D and 3D terrain; includes 2D isometric maps and Minecraft-style block terrain


  * Procedural Modeling; includes a nice recipe for procedural tree generation


  * Creating Water and Sky


  * Non-Player Characters; A*, state machines and dialogue


  * Animation; SkinnedEffect, Kinect and rag doll physics


  * Creating Vehicles


  * Receiving player input


  * Networking


Overall I think this is a useful book for intermediate+ developers interested in making games with XNA 4.0.
