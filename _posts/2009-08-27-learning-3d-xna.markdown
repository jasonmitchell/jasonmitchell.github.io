I've been doing 2D [XNA](http://www.xna.com/) for about a year and a half now and I feel I'm fairly competent at it, largely due to my experience in the [Imagine Cup](http://imaginecup.com/), so over this past week or so I've begun working on my first 3D XNA game.  I've had the concept for the game in my head and been thinking it through quite a lot and now I feel I am ready to begin some of the core programming.  Some time in the future I may give some more details about the project but as I am aiming to get it on the [Xbox Live Indie Games](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/community/default.htm), I feel like I should keep quiet for now until I get a substantial amount of work done!

I've found the 3D work so far quite enjoyable, I've encountered a few strange issues and differences that you wouldn't come across in a 3D game but that's all part of the learning curve.  I'm putting into practice a lot of the lessons I have learnt from my placement at Microsoft already in terms of class design project structure and hope to create a robust game that I should be able to maintain easily.

I plan on updating this blog as I go along with something similar to a tutorial series and will hopefully be able to fill in some the gaps that are left by some of the "How to..." and "Introduction to..." tutorials.
