While working on my Windows Phone application I stumbled across the [Buddy](http://buddy.com) Platform.  Buddy offers a cross-platform "backend as a service"; this immediately piqued my interest as I wasn't looking forward to implementing my own web services and paying for expensive hosting.

Buddy provides a wide range of functionality through a set of SOAP and REST web services and also provides detailed analytics and a developer dashboard to manage your application data.  Here are some snippets of how the team at Buddy describe the platform on their website:





<blockquote>

> 
> ### Build connected apps with no server-side code
> 
> 
Buddy enables developers to build engaging, cloud-connected apps without having to write, test, manage or scale server-side code or infrastructure.

Build against Buddy's collections of APIs that offer complete end-to-end scenarios like geo-location, photo albums, chat/messaging, image filters, user accounts, friends and more.</blockquote>




<blockquote>

> 
> ### Rich contextual analytics, no extra code required
> 
> 

> 
> Every interaction that a user has with an app built on Buddy generates incredibly high fidelity analytics, all captured in real-time by the Platform with no additional client or server-side code required.
> 
> 

> 
> Track usage of each feature in your app by demographics, location and intent - now you can go "back in time" and adjust the metrics you're tracking without needing to update and resubmit your app.
> 
> 
</blockquote>




I'm hoping to follow up this article soon with some code samples from what I have been working on with Buddy.
