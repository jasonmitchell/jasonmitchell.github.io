This was a project that was mostly pointless and impractical but is as bizarre as this article’s title makes it sound.  One day about two years ago I was bored, very bored.  I was at a total loss for small projects to work on in the evenings after work.  Somehow I came up with the idea to make a multiplayer XNA Tic Tac Toe game which used Twitter mentions for sending messages between players (wtf…I know).  Basically the game constructs simple text “commands” and posts them to a Twitter account and the other player’s game would poll Twitter looking for messages from the other player.

I decided to post this project because I’ve been at a loss for what to write about recently and I thought this project was so strange that I thought I should share it.  The project was made in XNA 3.0 or 3.1 and may not work anymore depending on what has changed with Twitter’s API; I really don’t know and I haven’t run the game in quite some time.
