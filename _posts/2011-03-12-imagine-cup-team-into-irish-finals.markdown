This year I’m mentoring a team at my university in the [Imagine Cup](http://imaginecup.com/); I don’t have the time to actually compete so this is a great way for me to stay involved with it.  On 04/03/2011 we received an email from Microsoft Ireland informing us that the team got through to the Irish Finals to compete for the opportunity to represent Ireland in the global competition.

This was great news and I’m really excited for the team to have the opportunity to experience this as it’s a great chance for them to learn loads and develop new skills in the technologies they are using to develop their application.  There’s a lot of work to be done but I’m sure they can manage it!  Best of luck to them at the Irish Finals!
