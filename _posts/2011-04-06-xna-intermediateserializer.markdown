Recently I’ve been doing a lot of [XNA](http://create.msdn.com) work which involves loading XML files via the content pipeline and I frequently found myself wanting to do more with the IntermediateSerializer than the basics.  I did a bit of a search and came up with the following blog article by [Shawn Hargreaves](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/) that has helped me out loads:

[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2008/08/12/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-intermediateserializer.aspx](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnhar/archive/2008/08/12/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-intermediateserializer.aspx)

For anyone working with XML and the content pipeline in XNA I strongly recommend taking a read through it!
