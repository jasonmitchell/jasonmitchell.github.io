title: Introduction to Domain Driven Design
---

First introduction a couple of years back
I looked at it because there seemed to be a lot of talk about it
Jumping on the buzzword wagon
Initially thought it was just a way of writing code
But its more than that
In fact the non-code aspects are more important
These are what make ddd powerful
Enter The Blue Book by Eric Evans

This is the first post in what will be a series in which I document the things I have learnt
The purpose is to force myself to evaluate my knowledge (which is almost certainly wrong in many areas) by writing it down in a consumable manner (I will try to research and fact check)
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough" - Albert Einstein according to the internet and the internet is never wrong...
I also hope to be able to use the articles as a discussion point to hopefully get feedback on my understanding and learn from the process

What is DDD?
Tactical
Strategic
Complex?

What DDD is not?
A silver bullet
CQRS
Event Sourcing

How I'm applying DDD at work
Event storming
What is good about our approach?
What needs worked on?

How someone can get started with DDD?
Read THE BOOKS (start with red then blue)
Talk to other people interested in it
Remember the importance of the strategic element
