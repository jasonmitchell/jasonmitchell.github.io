Version 1.0 of Supernova Particle System for MonoGame now available!  Supernova makes it easy to setup particle effects in your games developed using MonoGame.  It was ported to run on MonoGame from my original XNA particle system on [CodePlex](http://microstar.codeplex.com/).

This build initially targets Windows 8 and 2D game development only.  Further support for other platforms and 3D particle effects to come.

Now available on NuGet: [https://nuget.org/packages/Supernova-Particle-System/](https://nuget.org/packages/Supernova-Particle-System/)
Source code available at: [https://github.com/jasonmitchell/supernova](https://github.com/jasonmitchell/supernova)

_See [http://jason-mitchell.com/game-development/2d-particle-system-for-xna/](http://jason-mitchell.com/game-development/2d-particle-system-for-xna/) for a description of the original XNA project on CodePlex.  Some parts have changed but not drastically._
