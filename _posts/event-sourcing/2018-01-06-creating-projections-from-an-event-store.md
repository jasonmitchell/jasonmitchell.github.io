title: Creating Projections From an Event Store
series: event-sourcing
published: false

Projections are the read model. They are a pre-generated view of the event store in some convenient query mechanism.  e.g. sql, redis etc

Typically simple, case specific  DTOs

They are generated by handling events in order and generating the state

This can be done via GES subscriptions

Rebuild projections from event store (also manage schema in projections)

I use Projac, pretty neat

What happens if an exception occurs?  Is it acceptable for this to be reported and to generate a bad read model?  Or should we just stop processing.
