title: How I deal with Imposter Syndrome
---

I first encountered the term [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) in Scott Hanselmans article "[I'm a Phoney. Are you?](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ImAPhonyAreYou.aspx)" and have been increasingly able to relate to what he has to say.  I decided to write this article in order to share my experiences with the affects of imposter syndrome and how I try to deal with it.

This article contains much more personal content than I am typically used to writing. I discussed this article and its value with a friend before beginning writing it; I was concerned that it wouldn't be worth writing and would just be perceived as a sob story.  This was his reply:

> The very reason you are worried about writing it is because you are questioning its worth which in itself is imposter syndrome.

This is a very good point and when I thought more about it I can think of many blog posts I didn't write in the past because I didn't think the content was good enough to be useful (rather than [focusing on what a blog is supposed to be](http://adamralph.com/2015/09/28/blog-equals-weblog/)).

I don't consider myself to be a bad developer.  I understand that software development is a huge topic and that we all have a lot to learn.  I have had a fair amount of success in my (relatively short) career so far. I have regularly had colleagues and friends coming to me for technical help and advice.  Despite this I sometimes find myself doubting that I deserve to be where I am in my career.  In particular when I am discussing complex topics with people who know more about them than me I can be really doubting of my own abilities.  I know that **_no one knows everything and that we all have a lot to learn_** however were it as easy as just understanding that I, and so many others, would not be affected by imposter syndrome.  When I think about it realistically like this I realise how irrational it sounds.

So how do I deal with imposter syndrome?

I now **discuss it openly and honestly**; in the past I've always avoided the subject in an attempt to come across as confident and knowledgable.  I've found that by discussing it people are very supportive and I am not alone; it reinforces the fact that we all have stronger and weaker areas of knowledge due to experience and personal interests.  It's important to remember that **we don't know everything and that's okay**.
