On Wednesday and Thursday I was down at Microsoft Ireland in Dublin for the [Imagine Cup](http://imaginecup.com/) Irish finals with the team I was mentoring from the University of Ulster Coleraine.  Unfortunately we didn’t make it into the top 5 but it was great for our team of first year students to get down and experience the whole event.




I left Microsoft on Thursday really impressed with the quality of the projects at the competition this year.  I really feel like the projects were a step up from the previous year and it was great to see so many people making use of Kinect and Windows Phone 7.  Big congratulations to Team HERMES from IT Sligo who came first and will go on to represent Ireland at the Imagine Cup world finals in New York.
